          <p>Delegates Are Supposed To Reflect The Voters&#39; Will, But In States Like California And Florida, Votes Are Not Being Weighted Equally.<br><br>

          Despite constant claims by top party officials that Donald Trump would not win the Republican presidential nomination, it appears as though he has strong-armed his way to the top. But the Republican National Committee assisted Trump when late last year it announced rules changes to its primary calendar.<br><br>

          To prevent a race among the states to hold earlier elections &#45; which can give states more importance by knocking out early contenders &#45; the RNC allowed states to use a &#34;winner-take-all&#34; system to award delegates if their primary or caucus was held on or after March 15th.<br><br>

          Awarding all of a state&#39;s delegates to a single candidate who wins the popular vote &#45; regardless of whether or not they win a majority &#45; can greatly swing the momentum of the race, so many states took advantage.<br><br>

          As evidenced by the table below, the number of states using the winner-take-all system is now on par with those choosing winner-take-most or proportional.</p></div>

          <p>By opting into a winner-take-all delegate system, these states are choosing to ignore votes cast for anyone of than a popular vote winner. This has been a key component to Donald Trump&#39;s insurgent campaign success as he has frequently failed to earn 50 percent of the vote total.<br><br>

          Florida and California, examples of the two types of winner-take-all states, offer a glimpse into how these systems ignore and essentially throw out the votes of millions of citizens.</p>

      <p>Tuesday, March 15th, 2016 was a critical junction in the GOP primary race. Five key states awarded 358 delegates to the various presidential hopefuls. Millions of voters flocked to their polling stations.<br><br>

      But by the end of the day, many of those votes would be disregarded and ignored.<br><br>

      Of the five states voting, three used the winner-take-all delegate system. Those states were Illinois, Ohio, and Florida.<br><br>

      Illinois broke for Donald Trump, Ohio for John Kasich. The home state win was a critical one for the Kasich campaign, Ohio&#39;s 66 delegates buoyed Kasich&#39;s presidential hopes and served to give the current governor a boost in momentum.<br><br>

      The same could not be said for Marco Rubio.<br><br>

      Rubio lost his home state of Florida by more than 18 percentage points to Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, which effectively put an end to his bid for the nomination. Rubio would announce the suspension of his campaign that very night. <br><br>

      Trump earned 1,079,870 votes compared to Rubio&#39;s 638,661, according to <a href="http://www.thegreenpapers.com/">The Green Papers</a>, but when taken in context of all votes cast for every candidate, Trump earned only 45.72 percent of Floridian votes. And yet Trump walked away with all 99 delegates.<br><br>

      You may be asking yourself, &#34;How can a candidate not win a majority of the vote and still walk away with ALL the delegates?&#34;<br><br>

      The answer is: Because those are the rules.<br><br>

      &#34;Whether you like it or not this is the game we&#39;re playing,&#34; said Scott Paine, Director of Leadership Development and Education at the Florida League of Cities, Inc. &#34;The party leadership saw making it a winner-take-all primary as making it a critically important one in the campaign process.&#34;<br><br>

      The Florida GOP leadership should consider it mission accomplished.<br><br>

      Florida&#39;s winner-take-all system spelled doom for the Rubio campaign as his second-place finish awarded him zero delegates to Trump&#39;s 99. And while their state became a critical battleground for the GOP nomination, it came at the cost of many voters&#39; voices.<br><br>

      One such voter was Donna La Rocca of Naples, Florida. After choosing to register as a Republican so that she could vote against Trump, she feels that her voice has been suppressed by her state&#34;s political system.<br><br>

      &#34;Florida&#39;s voting system is completely corrupt,&#34; said La Rocca. &#34;Fifty percent of voters are not represented.&#34;<br><br>

      But there are others who would disagree.<br><br>

      Linda Wentzell of Windermere, Florida is a Trump supporter and supports the current GOP delegate system.<br><br>

      &#34;I don&#39;t like that someone can come in and snake away more delegates when they have not won the popular vote,&#34; said Wentzell.<br><br>

      But with Trump not winning a majority of the vote either, it&#34;s questionable to deny any delegates to a candidate turning out over half a million voters. Indeed, the outcome could have been exactly the same had Rubio lost the state by a single vote.<br><br>

      This just illustrates how divided voters are in Florida on their current system. But as Paine describes, your stance is often dictated by how well your candidate performs.<br><br>

      &#34;It&#39;s not to say that the policy is good or bad, but I think the people who complain are the ones whose candidate simply couldn&#39;t compete, and it frustrates them,&#34; said Paine. &#34;Like any set of rules would if your candidate couldn&#39;t compete according to the rules.&#34;<br><br>

      There&#39;s no question that Florida&#39;s winner-take-all system helped Trump in his insurgent-style campaign. But maybe that&#39;s what happens when you decide to ignore the voices of half your voters.</p>

              <p>The Golden State is known for many things. Agriculture. Tech. Hollywood. Not as well known are the inner workings of its Republican primary and how the state&#39;s 172 delegates are awarded.<br><br>

              California is broken down into 53 congressional districts with three delegates per district. Unlike other winner-take-all states where the popular vote winner is awarded 100 percent of the delegates, California is &#34;winner-take-all by congressional district and statewide.&#34;<br><br>

              This means that within each district, the winner of the popular vote receives all three delegates. An additional 13 delegates are bound to the winner of the statewide popular vote. <br><br>

              Regardless of population differences, all congressional districts have the same amount of delegates to be won. Because of this, if the number of registered Republican voters in your district is smaller, the candidates can win with fewer total votes. <br><br>

              In congressional district 13 there are around 27,000 registered Republicans. This means that a candidate needs to win just around 9,000 votes per delegate. <br><br>

              By comparison, in congressional district four, there are 175,401 registered Republicans. Per delegate, the candidates need 58,467 votes, yet their reward would be exactly the same as winning the much smaller district 13. <br><br>

              Though California has yet to vote in 2016, past elections can offer some insight into how this system plays out in reality.<br><br>

              During the 2008 Republican primary, Mitt Romney won 1,238,988 votes while John McCain won 1,013,471. Although the difference in votes earned between the two was only 8 percent, McCain walked away with 155 delegates to Romney's 15 because of the state's modified winner-take-all system.<br><br>

              In 2012, Republican candidate Mitt Romney received 4,395 votes and earned 3 delegates in congressional district 40. In congressional district four, Romney won 75,610 votes, but still gained just three delegates.<br><br>

              Historically California has had a troubled delegate system. California usually goes last in the primary when a candidate has already been decided, resulting in frequent frustration for voters.<br><br>

              This year California's primary takes place in July. However in 1996, 2000, and 2004 California attempted to move its primary up to March, but other states did the same.<br><br>

              This resulted in fierce advertising and fundraising while limiting the amount of potential candidates. Because of this, the Republican National Committee created rules to keep states from holding early primaries.<br><br>

              Although California is not technically a winner-take-all state, since the 2000 election, only one candidate each election has walked away with a considerable amount of delegates.</p>

              <p>In the end, no system of representation is perfect. But the rise of the winner-take-all states only ensures that the voices of millions of voters nationwide are ignored in the choice of their own representatives.<br><br>

              Florida and California serve as examples of how an imbalanced delegate system can contribute to the rise of a candidate that the majority of voters do not support.<br><br>

              Trump's success cannot be traced back to a single choice or decision by party leadership, but the winner-take-all system certainly paved the way for his rise. Like it or not, we all have to deal with the consequences.</p></div>
